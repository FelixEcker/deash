# deash
A shell with ALGOL-Style syntax for scripting and a name of which I do not remember
the meaning of.

## Building
deash requires the freepascal compiler (fpc) >= 3.2.2

To build it simply run the `build.sh` script from this repo, if you wish to have
debug messages simply supply the script with the `debug` parameter.

## Documents
See the `docs` directory for various documents such as the deash specification (`deash_spec.sad`).
Documents in the `sad` format can be viewed and converted to HTML using [sadv](https://github.com/FelixEcker/sadv).
